**Attendees:** Cindy, Laure, Yiqi

**What Went Well**

- Production deployment was smooth and required no major rework.

- A/B test endpoint implementation was fast and accurate, matching spec exactly.

- Team collaboration remained strong, with clear division of responsibilities.

- All major Sprints 2–3 features remained stable after deployment.

**What Didn’t Go Well**

- Data cleanup required significantly more time than expected.

- Role-based authentication exposed deeper architectural issues, slowing progress.

- UI inconsistencies became more obvious once deployed to production.

**What To Improve**

- Perform early backend housekeeping to avoid compounding complexity.

- Action: Begin Sprint 5 by finalizing all data cleanup.

- Define shared UI patterns early.

- Action: Standardize spacing, typography, and layout before further UI work.
